# provider_example

A simple [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) app that uses the [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package as state management solution. This app simulates getting data from an api, shows the data as a list of items on the interface and also caches those data to local storage so that it can load those data while offline.

The app also simulates server errors and internet connection errors.
